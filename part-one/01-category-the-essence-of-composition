# 1 implement id
# Implement, as best as you can, the identity function in your favorite language (or the second favorite, if your favorite language happens to be Haskell).

#multi sub id ($x) { $x }
multi sub id (*@_) { @_ }

# like C++   template<class T> T id(T x) { return x; }
#role Any[::T] {
    # which of these?
#    method id(T $x --> T) { $x }
#    sub id(T $x --> T) { $x }
#    T sub id(T $x) { $x }
#    T method id(T $x) { $x }
#}


# 2 implement function composition
# Implement the composition function in your favorite language. It takes two functions as arguments and returns a function that is their composition.

sub compose (&g, &f) { sub (|c) { g(f(|c)) } }

# 3 test that composition respect identity
# Write a program that tries to test that your composition function respects identity.

use Test;
sub dub ($x) { $x ~ $x }
#sub add (Int $x, Int $y) { $x + $y }
#sub alsoadd (|c) { add(|c) }
#is add(2,2), 4, 'add works';
#is alsoadd(2,2), 4, 'alsoadd works';
is dub('a'), 'aa', 'dub works';
my $c = compose(&dub, &id);
#$c.perl.say;
is $c('a'), 'aa', 'composed gets same';
#is $c(2,2), 4, 'compose gets same';
#is compose(&add, &id)(2,2), 4, 'compose gets same';


# 4. Is the world-wide web a category in any sense? Are links morphisms?
# Not really.  Links don't necessarily compose.  If site A links to site B, and 
# site B links to site C, it does not necessarily follow that site A links
# directly to site C.

# 5. Is Facebook a category, with people as objects and friendships as morphisms?
# In the general case, no.  Friends of friends aren't necessarily my friend.

# 6. When is a directed graph a category?
# When all nodes are connected directly.
